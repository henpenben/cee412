'''# Summary'''

'''
there are a lot of accidents

since we don't have vehicle miles traveled we cannot say for certain if younger drivers crash more frequently

even still, the quantity of accidents in just the range of 16-21 is nearly 500, and the 33 year range of 31-65 has 1806. If the 16-21 age groups had the same number of years, it would be about 3000 crashes.
