## Project Background, Motivation, and Goal:

The purpose of this project proposal is to explore the Highway Safety and Information System (HSIS) database to shed light on the leading causes of driver crashes based on age. This involves a thorough analysis of data to group accident causes for different driver ages and present the results in a presentable format. The objective is to provide valuable insights into the relationship between age and crash causes, especially as relating to avoidable accidents.

## Project Hypothesis and Plan

Our hypothesis is that younger drivers will have a higher number of crashes, particularly those that are preventable. To test this, we will gather data from the HSIS database and use SQL and other analytical tools to analyze the data and present the results.
